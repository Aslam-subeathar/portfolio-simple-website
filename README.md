# My Portfolio Website
Welcome to my portfolio website! This project consists of two main pages, the home page and the contact page. I've designed and implemented this website using HTML for structure and basic CSS for styling, creating a simple and effective showcase of my skills and a convenient way to get in touch.

# pages
Home Page:
Introduction: Learn more about me through a brief introduction and overview of my skills.

Project Showcase: Explore the projects I've worked on, presented in a visually appealing manner.

# Technologies used:
HTML: Used for structuring the content and layout of both the home and contact pages.

CSS: Applied basic styling to enhance the visual appeal and user experience.
